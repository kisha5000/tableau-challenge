# Citibike - Tableau Challenge

I thought it might be good to compare how bike riding was affected in the spring months of 2019 vs the spring months of  and the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown.
I looked at March through May of both 2019 and 2020 data sets. After merging the data via Union, and creating groups of the data via the years, I could confirm that the initial shock of the lockdown in late March and April definitely affected bike rentals, but in May, there was a surge comparable to the surge of rentals in 2020.

#Gender Effects

The gender of riders seemed to grow at a proportional rate from 2019 to 2020, but males really slowed down riding in April, and doubling their rides in May of 2020. Even then, they used bikes half as much as they did in 2019 in May. It is interesting to see the drop in over 50% pf male riders from 2019 to 2020, while the dorp in Female and unkonown riders was nominal, given the circumstances.

#Should I 'Click Subscribe'?

The renters that were subscribers definitely maintained a comfortability with riding during the pandemic, as the day renters (customers slowed down in the beginning of the pandemic, but we see that in April and May, a few more renters became subscribers, but by enlarge, most riders are customers.
Grove street was definitely a popular station to start fro in 2019 with over 311,000 bike starts there in the Spring, but it dropped by half in total bike rentals, at only 114,000 bikes. While Grove St. dwindled in rides, Libert Park prospered, doubling its bike starts from spring 2019 to the beginning Covid months in 2020.
The surge at Liberty Park could be attributed to the hikig, canoeing, and other fu n outodor activities available there, it makes sense to rent a few bikes!
